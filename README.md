# NFT_Randomizer
Given a root folder (NFTImages) with a default model and as many folders as the user wish, the program will take one image of each and create a final image mixing the diferent images. All images must have transparent background (There is also a project to do this in my GitHub)

How to use:
1-Model folder must be in the root and named: 1.png.
2-Must create a folder called "Result".
3-As many folders as you wish ordered by body parts (head: all head images, arms: all arms images).
4-Run the project

NFTImages: Result, 1.png, Folder1, Folder2, Folder.....
